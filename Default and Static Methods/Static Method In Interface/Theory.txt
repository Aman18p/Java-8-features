⇒ Static Methods in Interface :-

-> Till 1.7 version we were not able to create any static method in an interface but from 1.8 version we can create static methods in an interface
-> Static methods have implementation part in the interface only
-> Static methods are created by using "static" keyword

-> Note :

-> We can use public access-modifier with static method
-> We cannot use default keyword with static method
-> We were not able to override static methods. If we try to override it, it will be treated as different method
-> Static methods are used to improve the shareability in interface
