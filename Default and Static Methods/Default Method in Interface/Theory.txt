⇒ Default Methods in Interface :-

-> Interface can contain only abstract methods which does not have any implementation part and its implementations where provided in the implemented class
-> But from 1.8 version, we can create default methods having implementation part in interface. And if we are not satisfied with default method implementation, then we can override that method and provide its our new implementation.
-> Default methods are created by using "default" keyword.
