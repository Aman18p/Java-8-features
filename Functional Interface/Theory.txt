⇒ Functional Interfaces :-

-> If any interface contains only and only one abstract method, then it is known as Functional Interface
-> To denote function interface we use "@FunctionalInterface" annotation

-> Cases for Functional Interface :-

We can create any number of "default" or "static" methods in functional interface but we can create only and only one abstract method.

In case of inheritance if any interface have more than one abstract method, then also it will not be treated as Functional Interface.

⇒ Marker Interface :-

-> If any interface does not contain any abstract method, then it is known as marker interface
-> Predefined marker interfaces are Cloneable, Serializable, Remote etc.

//⇒ Annotations :-

  -> Annotations are used to provide some additional information about the program.
  -> Annotations starts with "@"
  -> If we use or dont use annotations then there is no effect on the compiler.
  -> Annotations provides some metadata for classes or interfaces or methods or variables or constructors.
