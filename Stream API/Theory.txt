Stream API :-

-> Stream API is related to "Collection Framework" or "Group of objects".
-> The Stream API (introduced in Java 8) is used to process collections of data (List, Set, Map) in a functional, declarative, and readable way.
-> It does not store data 👉 It processes data from a source.
-> It is use to process or to perform bulk operation on Collection Object or Group of objects.

Steam API Lifecycle:-
👉 Get Stream Instance
👉Perform Operations such as filter(), sort(), map(), etc and transform it into another stream.
👉Perform Terminal Operation such as count(), sum() etc and produces the result.

Stream Interface:-
-> Stream is an interface which is present is java.util.stream package.
-> Stream is an interface that represents a sequence of elements and supports aggregate operations like filter, map, and reduce.
-> The Stream interface is part of the Java 8 Stream API and is used to process a sequence of elements in a functional style.

Syntax:-

    public interface Stream
    {
       foreach();
       filter();
       map();
       collect();

       sorted();
       min();
       max();
       count();

       // some static methods
       of() {-}
       empty() {-}
       builder() {-}
    }

Why Stream API?

-> Less code, more clarity
-> No explicit loops
-> Supports functional interfaces (Predicate, Function, Consumer)
-> Easy filtering, mapping, sorting.
