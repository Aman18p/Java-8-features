 A Lambda Expression is a feature introduced in Java 8 that provides a concise way to implement the abstract method of a Functional Interface.
 -> It represents an anonymous function, meaning a function without a name, access modifier, or return type.
 -> Lambda expressions help in writing cleaner, shorter, and more readable code.

 Key Characteristics
-> No method name is required
-> No return type is specified (compiler infers it)
-> No access modifier is used
-> Code is executed when the abstract method is called.

Rules of Lambda Expression
-> It can be used only with a functional interface
-> The parameter type is optional (type inference)
-> Parentheses are optional for a single parameter
-> Curly braces and return keyword are optional for a single statement
-> Lambda expression can take any number of parameters.
-> Lambda expressions cannot contain instance variables
-> If lambda expression is returning any value then we can remove return keyword.
